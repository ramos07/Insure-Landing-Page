# Insure Landing Page

## A landing page for an insurance company.

### Purpose :brain:

I wanted to keep working on my HTML and CSS skills and this project provided a good challenge. This project was one of the many challenges by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), a website that gives developers the opportunity to hone their front end development skills. They provide the designs, the images, fonts, etc.

### Pending :clock9:

[] Working on making the site responsive.

### What It Looks Like So Far :computer:
